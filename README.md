## Abstract

Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning‚Äîsuch as DeepSeek-R1‚Äîhave achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically probe these limitations, we introduce **OMEGA**, a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:

1. **Exploratory** ‚Äî applying known problem-solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain
2. **Compositional** ‚Äî combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways  
3. **Transformative**  ‚Äî adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively

MathOOD consists of programmatically generated training‚Äìtest pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods.

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üìä Benchmark Structure

### Problem Categories

MathOOD covers six major mathematical domains:

- **üî¢ Arithmetic** - Matrix operations, GCD, prime factorization
- **üìê Geometry** - Circles, polygons, perpendicular intersections  
- **üî§ Algebra** - Function analysis, polynomial roots, linear equations
- **üé≤ Combinatorics** - Probability, pattern matching, distributions
- **üß© Logic** - Grid-world problems, constraint satisfaction
- **üìä Number Theory** - Quadratic residues, ordered sets

### Generalization Types (Example)

#### 1. Exploratory Generalization [![HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20HuggingFace-Datasets-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/omega-explorative)
Tests scaling to more complex instances within the same domain:
- **Training**: Simple 2x2 matrix determinants
- **Testing**: Complex 5x5 matrix determinants

#### 2. Compositional Generalization [![HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20HuggingFace-Datasets-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/omega-compositional) 
Tests combining multiple mathematical skills:
- **Training**: Geometry (circle properties) + Algebra (function intersection)
- **Testing**: Problems requiring both skills simultaneously

#### 3. Transformative Generalization [![HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20HuggingFace-Datasets-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/omega-transformative)
Tests adoption of novel solution strategies:
- **Training**: Standard polynomial root-finding methods
- **Testing**: Complex analysis techniques (De Moivre's theorem)

### Problem Collection Structure

The benchmark includes three specialized problem collections that implement different generalization paradigms:

#### `problems/explorative/`
Contains **exploratory generalization** datasets that test scaling within the same mathematical domain. Models are trained on low-complexity problems and evaluated on progressively harder instances from the same template. Examples:
- **Algebra**: Function analysis (area, derivatives, extrema, intersections, zeros), linear equations, polynomial roots
- **Arithmetic**: Number (GCD, prime factorization), matrix operations (determinant, eigenvalues, inverse, multiplication, power, rank, SVD)
- **Combinatorics**: Probability analysis, pattern matching, distribution problems

#### `problems/compositional/`
Features **compositional generalization** scenarios that combine distinct mathematical domains from training into novel multi-domain problems. Examples:
- Algebra (polynomial roots) + Arithmetic (GCD)
- Geometry (circles) + Algebra (function intersection) 
- Combinatorics (probability) + Matrix operations (rank)
- Geometry (polygon properties) + Pattern matching

#### `problems/transformative/`
Presents **transformative generalization** challenges requiring fundamentally different solution approaches than those seen in training. Examples:
- Matrix rank problems requiring advanced linear algebra techniques
- Function intersection via complex analysis methods
- Polynomial root-finding using De Moivre's theorem
- Spatial reasoning problems requiring geometric transformations

Each folder contains detailed README files with dataset links and problem descriptions.
